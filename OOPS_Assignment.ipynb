        "####Ans:- bject-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm centered around the concept of \"objects\" which are instances of classes. The five key concepts of OOP are:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Class:- A class is a blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines a set of attributes (data) and methods (functions) that the objects created from the class can use.\n",
        "\n",
        "    Example: Consider a class called Car. This class might have attributes like color, model, and year, and methods like start_engine() and stop_engine()\n",
        "2. Object:- An object is an instance of a class. It is a concrete entity based on the class, and it can have its own unique values for the attributes defined in the class.\n",
        "\n",
        "    Example: Using the Car class:-\n",
        "\n",
        "    my_car = Car(\"Red\", \"Toyota\", 2020)\n",
        "    your_car = Car(\"Blue\", \"Honda\", 2019)\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Encapsulation:- Encapsulation is the concept of bundling the data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit, or class. It also involves restricting access to certain components of an object to protect the internal state of the object.\n",
        "\n",
        "    Example: In the Car class, you might make some attributes private (i.e., not accessible from outside the class) to prevent them from being modified directly.\n",
        "\n",
        "4.  Inheritance:- Inheritance allows a new class to inherit attributes and methods from an existing class. This promotes code reuse and can create a natural hierarchy between classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "    Example: Suppose you have a class Vehicle, and you want to create a Car class that inherits properties from Vehicle.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Polymorphism:- Polymorphism allows methods to do different things based on the object it is acting upon, even though they share the same name. It means \"many forms\" and refers to the ability to use a single interface to represent different types of objects.\n",
        "\n",
        "    Example: You might have different classes like Car and Bike, both having a method start(), but each class has its own way of implementing it."

        "###Ans:- The Diamond Problem is a well-known issue in object-oriented programming that arises with multiple inheritance. It occurs when a class inherits from two or more classes that have a common base class, leading to ambiguity in the inheritance hierarchy. This can result in problems like:\n",
        "\n",
        " Ambiguity: It is unclear which method or attribute should be inherited if there are multiple paths to the same base class.\n",
        "\n",
        "Redundancy: Methods or attributes might be inherited multiple times, leading to redundant code or unexpected behavior.\n",
        "\n",
        "####How Python Resolves the Diamond Problem:-\n",
        "Python uses a method resolution order (MRO) algorithm to address the Diamond Problem.\n",
        "\n",
        "Specifically, Python uses the C3 Linearization algorithm, which provides a consistent order for method resolution. This algorithm ensures that the order is deterministic and respects the hierarchy.\n",

        "The C3 Linearization algorithm computes the MRO for a class by:\n",

        "Combining the MROs of the parent classes.\n",
        "Respecting the order of base classes as defined in the class definition.\n",
        "Maintaining a consistent linearization that honors the class hierarchy."
